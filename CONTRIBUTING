# Contributing

Hey, thanks for your interest in contributing to the NYU CS Wiki! Please review this document **before making a pull request**.

## Guidelines and Style

- Follow a second ('you can...') or third ('it is..') person point of view when writing articles
- Make sure to cite your sources; this can be done [via markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#footnotes). For an example, look at the ``Holodeck: High Speed Research Network`` article citations.
- Keep it (mostly) professional

## üë∑ Development 

You will need node/npm installed and then need to run ``npm install`` in the project directory (this will grab all the dependencies). From here, you can create your own articles/modifications to the source in either the /docs or /src directories, respectively. After, to run the project: 

- üöß Development (does not include search index):
  ```sh
  npm start
  ```
- üè≠ Production (includes search index):
  ```sh
  npm run build
  npm run serve
  ```
