# Contributing

Hey, thanks for your interest in contributing to the NYU CS Wiki! Please review this document **before making a pull request**.

## Guidelines and Style

- Follow a second ('you can...') or third ('it is..') person point of view when writing articles
- Make sure to cite your sources; this can be done [via markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#footnotes). For an example, look at the ``Holodeck: High Speed Research Network`` article citations.
- Keep it (mostly) professional

## üë∑ Development 

You will need node/npm installed and then need to run ``npm install`` in the project directory (this will grab all the dependencies). From here, you can create your own articles/modifications to the source in either the /docs or /src directories, respectively. ```npm start``` supports hot reloading of the project, meaning that your changes will be reflected automatically on the development build. Unless you need the search, it is recommended to use the former option.

- üöß Development (does not include search index):
  ```sh
  npm start
  ```
- üè≠ Production (includes search index):
  ```sh
  npm run build
  npm run serve
  ```
