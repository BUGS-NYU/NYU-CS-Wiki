# De-Stress During Midterm Season

## How to De-Stress During Midterm Season at NYU

Feeling stressed? Here are some tips to help you relax and stay focused during midterms:

### 1. Take a Power Nap (15-30 Minutes)
Sometimes, a quick nap is all you need to recharge! It’s the perfect way to refresh and refocus without feeling groggy.

### 2. Stay Hydrated
Keep that water bottle close! Staying hydrated is crucial for focus and reducing stress.

### 3. Go on Walks
A quick walk around Washington Square Park can give you a break from studying and get your energy up!

### 4. Eat Balanced Meals
Midterms require fuel! Make sure you’re eating well-balanced meals—your brain needs the energy for long study sessions!

### 5. Talk to Your Professor or TA
Professors and TAs are here to help! Drop by their office hours prepared with questions, or even just to listen in—it can help you understand tricky topics. (Come prepared since midterm season can get busy!)

### 6. Form Study Groups
Study groups can make tough subjects easier and more enjoyable. Teaching others is also a great way to reinforce what you know!

### 7. Check Out NYU Club Events
NYU Engage has tons of de-stress events, from painting sessions to yoga. Check out the link to find activities that can give you a mental break! You’ll also find social and professional events for:

### 8. Start Early and Plan Your Schedule
Use tools like Google Calendar to organize your study schedule. Start studying early so you can pace yourself!

### 9. Find Your Study Spot
NYU has so many study spaces! Here are a few favorites:
- **Bobst Library**: 4th floor is quiet, but the 2nd floor—also quiet with fewer people—is my favorite. Want to chat while studying? Head to the 5th floor!
- **Lipton Community Lounge**
- **Kimmel**: 7th and 2nd floors, plus the commuter lounge near Peet’s Coffee.
- **Courant Institute**: 13th floor—nice and quiet.
- **Paulson Center**: The 3rd floor has a quiet study room with cubicles.
- **Dorm Study Rooms**: For on-campus residents, dorm study rooms are super convenient!
- **Center for Data Science**: The 7th-floor open space is great for data science students!

### 10. Best Coffee Spots Around Campus
Need a caffeine fix? Here are my go-to cafes around campus:
- **Think Coffee**: Great lattes, strong coffee, and several locations around the city.
- **La Colombe**: Try the oat milk draft latte—it’s amazing!
- **Whistle & Fizz**: Tons of drink options, like the Mango Nitro Green Tea and Sea Salt & Caramel Latte!
- **787 Coffee**: Known for its creative lattes, like the Horchata Latte, it’s a great spot for a change of scenery.
