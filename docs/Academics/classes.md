# Recommended Classes

A list of recommended classes by former students. If you would like to add/update this list, send a [pull request](https://github.com/BUGS-NYU/nyu-cs-wiki/pulls)!

## Tandon

- Algorithmic Machine Learning and Data Science
  
  Course Description: This course gives a behind-the-scenes look into the algorithms and computational methods that make machine learning and data science work at large scale. How does a service like Shazam match a sound clip to a library of 10 million songs in under a second? How do scientists find patterns in terabytes of genetic data? How can we efficiently train neural networks with billions of parameters on terabytes of data? We will address these questions and others by studying advanced algorithmic techniques like randomization, approximation, sketching, continuous optimization, spectral methods, and Fourier methods.

  I really enjoyed the applied mathematics and proofs in a machine learning context. However, be forewarned that this is a very difficult Tandon course; you should have few to no difficult other classes in the same semester. 

- Intro to Offensive Security (CS-UY 3943)

  Course Description: The purpose of this course is to teach the offensive side of cybersecurity, namely attacks. We will learn about and implement attacks for vulnerabilities in web applications and C/C++ binary programs (including bypasses for common exploit mitigations), learn how to reverse engineer assembly code, and break flawed cryptographic implementations.

  Comment: This class is a great introductory to Offensive Security Tools and methods in use by [penetration testers](https://www.synopsys.com/glossary/what-is-penetration-testing.html) and [hackers](https://cyberonline.sdsu.edu/blog/penetration-testing-vs-ethical-hacking/) in today's world. This is done through the use of Jeopardy Style [Capture-The-Flag competition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_the_flag_(cybersecurity)) where 100% of the grade is evaluated on the effectiveness of student's system breaches.

  Prerequisites: None*

  * Some experience in python scripting is expected. Please DO NOT take this class unless you have taken/are familiar with the concepts taught in Computer Architecture/Computer Systems Organization and Operating Systems.
