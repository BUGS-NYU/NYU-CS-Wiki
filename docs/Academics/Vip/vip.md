# Vertically Integrated Projects

[Vertically Integrated Projects (VIP)](https://engineering.nyu.edu/research-innovation/student-research/vertically-integrated-projects) are a unique long-term and large-scale project led by a faculty member at NYU. After applying, accepted students enroll in a VIP course in Albert like any other class. VIP can be taken for credit, usually 1. Up to 6 credits can be earned over multiple semesters. Different VIP teams have different needs and requirements. Generally, you can expect to spend a couple hours per week on VIP. VIP is a great way to get involved in research and work on a project that you are passionate about. VIP is also a great way to meet other students and faculty.

## Teams

A full list of teams is available on the [NYU website](https://engineering.nyu.edu/research-innovation/student-research/vertically-integrated-projects/vip-teams). 

CS Wiki also has an organized list of teams sorted by category with short descriptions to help quickly differentiate them. They are accessible in the sidebar under VIPs.

## How to Apply

On each team's page, there will be a link to an application form. Students can apply to VIP teams when registration opens for the upcoming semester. After being accepted by a team, you must enroll before the add/drop deadline in Albert. For more details, see the [NYU website](https://engineering.nyu.edu/research-innovation/student-research/vertically-integrated-projects/vip-recruitment).
