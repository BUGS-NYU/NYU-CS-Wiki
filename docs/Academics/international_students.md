# International Students

International students are an indispensable part of the student community. Here is some important information you may want to know. You may also check out the website of [OGS](https://www.nyu.edu/about/leadership-university-administration/office-of-the-president/office-of-the-provost/university-life/office-of-studentaffairs/office-of-global-services.html) or [The International Student Hub](https://www.nyu.edu/students/communities-and-groups/international-students/international-student-hub.html) for resources.

## Visa Eligibility

- For student visa and immigration in general, check out https://www.nyu.edu/students/student-information-and-resources/student-visa-and-immigration.html.
- There are regularly in-person info sessions and webinars about visas (F1/J1/CPT/OPT); keep an eye on opportunity emails from OGS too.

## Linguistic and Cultural Adoption

- International student services at the Wasserman Center are dedicated to help international students navigate the U.S. work environment and acclimate to American work culture. Visit [them](https://www.nyu.edu/students/student-information-and-resources/career-development-and-jobs/global-career-resources/international-student-services.html) for more resources.
- The best way to improve your proficiency in English is to practice more. There are also many resources to assist you. You may consult with [the Writing Center](https://cas.nyu.edu/ewp/writing-center.html).

## Internships

- You can gain academic credits with internships by taking *Internship in Computer Science* (CSCI-UA 897/989). For international students in specific, you will be given instruction to submit your CPT request form when your request for internship credit is approved by the department. For more details, check the [department website](https://cs.nyu.edu/home/undergrad/internships.html).
- To get paid from an on-campus job, you need to first apply for a social security number (SSN). Relative policies vary by department. Consult https://www.nyu.edu/students/student-information-and-resources/student-visa-and-immigration/current-students/employment-and-tax/social-security-number.html for more details.
