title: "Grace Hopper Scholarship by NYU Tandon"
---

Before I get into the whole topic of the actual scholarship, I would like the reader to be informed of who Grace Hopper is and why is so important in the history of Computer Science.

Grace Brewster Hopper was an American computer scientist. One of the first programmers of the Harvard Mark I computer, she was a pioneer of computer programming who invented one of the first linkers. Hopper was the first to devise the theory of machine-independent programming languages, and the FLOW-MATIC programming language she created using this theory was later extended to create COBOL, an early high-level programming language still in use today.

Fun fact: She was born in New York City, the city where NYU also resides.

You can read more about her on: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace\_Hopper

Now that you know who Grace Hopper is, let's talk about the celebration now.
The Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing (GHC) is a series of conferences designed to bring the research and career interests of women in computing to the forefront. It is the world's largest gathering of women and non-binary technologists. The celebration, named after computer scientist Grace Hopper, is organized by the Anita Borg Institute for Women and Technology.

Homework for the reader: Please find out who Anita Borg is, and why is she so important for the field of Computer Science.

So now for the stuff that you were waiting for, the scholarship. Even though GHC is a really good opportunity for students to attend, it can be really costly. The passes are categorized as being either in-person or virtual. Further, there is a subcategorization of being for academics or general. Please take a look at the following table for the pricing of 2023:

| In Person General | In Person Academic | Virtual General | Virtual Academic |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|       $1298       |        $649        |       $649      |       $199       |

Being students, you can book either of the academic passes, but they are still very expensive. The Office of Student Leadership & Engagement NYU Tandon provides an excellent opportunity for students to be funded and to attend this conference. The scholarship will pay for the registration, the flights, as well as the stay for the duration of the conference. The applications usually go live in mid-May, and are announced by an eemail from the Tandon OSLE office email address (engineering@nyu.edu).

So keep an eye out for the same. Some of the questions that are a part of the application are:
1. The CS and Math classes you have taken so far, and the grade attained in them.
2. A personal statement
3. Your cummulative GPA

I personally think this is a great opportunity for students to attend this amazing conference and make use of the networking opportunities as well as the on-site interviews that happen there.
