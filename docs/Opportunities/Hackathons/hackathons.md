# Hackathons

If you're new to computer science, a hackathon is a great way to get your hands dirty on some real world projects that you are interested in. Imagine it as a sprint-like event where programmers, designers, and enthusiasts from various disciplines come together to create, build, and develop projects.

# What

A hackathon is an event where people engage in rapid and collaborative engineering over a relatively short period of time such as 24 or 48 hours. Participants form teams to work on a project, often with a specific theme or to solve a particular problem. It's a space where ideas are transformed into reality, where you're encouraged to think outside the box and push boundaries.
