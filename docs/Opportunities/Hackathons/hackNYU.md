# HackNYU

[HackNYU](https://hacknyu.org/) is a 48-hour Global Hackathon Hosted by NYU. It's a great opportunity to showcase your problem solving skills and technical abilities. 

HackNYU also has a mini hackathon called mini-HackNYU which follows a similar format but with a shortened timeframe of 12 hours
