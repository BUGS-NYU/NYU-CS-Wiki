# HackNYU

[HackNYU](https://hacknyu.org/) is a 48-hour Global Hackathon Hosted by NYU. It's a great opportunity to showcase your problem solving skills and technical abilities.  

### Past Iterations
On December 3, 2023, HackNYU hosted a mini hackathon called mini-HackNYU. This 12-hour hackathon was home to at least 100 hackers where they collaborated, innovated, and brought their ideas to life through diverse projects. This hackathon included several tracks, such as gaming, lifestyle and health, financial empowerment, and interactive media and design.

### Future Plans
In the Fall of 2024, HackNYU will again host a 48-hour Global Hackathon. 
More details will come so stay tuned!
