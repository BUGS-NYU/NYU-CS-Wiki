# Chipotle

Manhattan:

- [117 E 14th St, New York, NY 10003](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/3071111733): Close to Palladium and the quality is pretty good.
- [405 6th Ave, New York, NY 10014](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/10709962653): Close to GCASL and the quality is decent. However, this store is about $1 more expensive than the one near Tandon (generally more expensive in Manhattan).
- [55 E 8th St Frnt 2, New York, NY 10003](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/2547165967): Also close to GCASL but the quality is consistently bad. Avoid this location if you can!
- [625 Broadway, New York, NY 10012](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/4255253129): Close to the Broadway-Lafayette train station and the quality is good.
- [71 Spring St, New York, NY 10012](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/5523437746): Close to Broome St Residence Hall. Tends to be stingy with the meat.

Brooklyn:

- [1 MetroTech Center, Brooklyn, NY 11201](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/4557451331): Close to Tandon so very convenient but it can also get crowded since everyone likes to go there during their lunch break. I would recommend trying to avoid between 12pm - 2pm.
- [474 Fulton St, Brooklyn, NY 11201](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/9023863625): Close to Dekalb; it's decent but you should probably go to Dekalb.

Bonus:

- [345 Adams St, Brooklyn, NY 11201](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/4559289816): Cava - good Mediterranean alternative to Chipotle; more expensive but more filling.
