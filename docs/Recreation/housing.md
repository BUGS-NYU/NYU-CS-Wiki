# Housing

Housing is a crucial aspect of student life. Although New York City offers abundant living resources, it also demands considerable housing expenses. Finding an ideal home may require time and, occasionally, a bit of luck. Here are some popular on-campus and off-campus housing options for students, along with some helpful suggestions.

## On Campus Living

Living in residence halls is the easiest way to engage with the community and find your sense of belonging. The school offers more than 20 locations across Brooklyn and Manhattan, featuring a variety of living options to suit your preferences. Below are some first-hand details of a selection of these options that may help inform your decisions.

## Off Campus Living

Apart from the school residence halls, you can also explore numerous off-campus housing options. A good starting point is the [platform](https://offcampushousing.nyu.edu/) provided by NYU. Additional external resources worth checking include [Streeteasy](https://streeteasy.com/) and [Apartments.com](https://www.apartments.com/new-york-ny/). It's also beneficial to network with other students to find out if anyone is graduating or moving out.

When choosing your housing, the most important factors to consider include safety in the area, access to transportation, commute time, availability of local amenities, and, of course, the rental price.
