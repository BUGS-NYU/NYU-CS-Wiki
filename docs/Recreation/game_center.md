# NYU Game Center

Located on the 6th floor of 370 Jay Street in Brooklyn, the NYU Game Center hosts a library of video games spanning console generations starting from the 1970s to the present, board games, and gaming computers. While primarily for the Bachelors/Masters of Fine Arts program students in Game Design at the Tisch School of Arts, the library is open to all NYU students. An inventory of video games available can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1R11_VvmYepsvQUcpjs4ZuMsYWdMNwegc1Gg1BebtU4Y/edit#gid=571633664).

There are also "Playtest Thursdays" hosted at 5:00 PM on the 2nd floor of 370 Jay Street where students can bring in a game they have been working on and receive feedback from students. More info can be found [here](https://gamecenter.nyu.edu/event/playtest-thursday-199/).
