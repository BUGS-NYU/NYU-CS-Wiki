How does a service like Shazam match a sound clip to a library of 10 million songs in under a second? How do scientists find patterns in terabytes of genetic data? How can we efficiently train neural networks with billions of parameters on terabytes of data? We will address these questions and others by studying advanced algorithmic techniques like randomization, approximation, sketching, continuous optimization, spectral methods, and Fourier methods. I really enjoyed the applied mathematics and proofs in a machine learning context. However, be forewarned that this is a very difficult Tandon course; you should have few to no difficult other classes in the same semester.

Fast Algorithms: Large-scale linear systems arise in a myriad of areas in physics, mathematics, and statistics. Often when directly discretizing PDEs, the resulting linear systems are sparse and efficient methods for applying the discretized operators are straightforward, and relatively efficient methods for computing their inverse has been developed. However, linear systems arising from the discretization of integral formulations of the very same PDEs are dense, and somewhat more sophisticated algorithms must be developed in order to apply and invert there operators with near optimal computational complexity. Often these algorithms are based on the underlying physics of the problem, and are therefore commonly referred to as analysis-based fast algorithms. ai @ NYU: We are in the middle of an Artificial Intelligence revolution.

We use artificial intelligence (AI) to better understand and care for the human brain, and in study the human brain to build better AI. Applied Dynamics and Optimization Laboratory: Our lab’s broad research areas include dynamics, control, and optimization of mechanical systems. Main domains for implementations and applications include robotic and biomechanical systems and their intersections such as lower-body wearable robots. FOX LAB: We aim to empirically answer relevant questions about personality and cognition. Conducting studies at high statistical power and with epistemic integrity is an overriding focus. Institutionally, the lab is situated at the intersection between Data Science, Psychology and Neuroscience, reflecting the inter-disciplinary nature of our research interests.Importantly, we also aim to communicate our findings in a clear and accessible fashion – be it in presentations, publications as well as public outreach. NYU Urban Modeling: Our mission is to bridge the gap between civil engineering and computer science to advance and expand the field of urban engineering. We focus on developing tools to better understand the urban built environment through pioneering new means to optimize and synthesize multi-modal data collection, storage, and processing. These tools work together to auto-generate high-resolution, functional models appropriate for engineering analysis and datasets of unprecedented density, comprehensiveness, and richness, which our group generates, aids this process. Computational Neuroimaging Laboratory » Home: The focus of the research in our lab is to develop a theory for the computations performed by neural circuits in the brain to quantitatively investigate the relationship between brain and behavior. Click on the Research tab for further details. computation &amp; cognition lab @ nyu: Our lab is interested in understanding the everyday forms of intelligence that make humans so smart. Despite recent advances, human intelligence still vastly out performs the abilities of our most intelligent machines such as robots, driverless cars, and virtual assistants. We want to understand why that gap exists and how to narrow it. However, what does it mean to &quot;understand&quot; something like intelligence? NYU Alignment Research Group: The NYU Alignment Research Group (ARG) is a set of researchers doing empirical work with language models that aims to address longer-term concerns about the impacts of deploying highly-capable AI systems. See our introductory post for more on what this is about and why we started this initiative. Music and Audio Research Laboratory | NYU Steinhardt: Music and Audio Research Laboratory is an interdisciplinary center at the intersection of science, technology, music and sound, with research connecting a wide range of fields from computing and artificial intelligence, immersive experiences and algorithmic composition, to the latest advances in neuroimaging of the human brain. Our work focuses on (a) understanding and modeling the human cognitive and neural mechanism supporting music and sound processing, (b) innovating the analysis, organization and retrieval of acoustic data, and (c) advancing applications of high societal value in health, accessibility, creativity, and education. NYU CTED: The Center for Technology and Economic Development (CTED) focuses on the development of innovative and cutting-edge technologies to significantly impact economic development with a specific focus on problems faced in underdeveloped areas around the world. Spanning Africa, Asia, and the Gulf, CTED’s research covers economic theory, global labor markets, migration, and the impact of technology on development. Machine Learning for Good Laboratory: Our lab is focused on development of novel machine learning methods for addressing critical urban problems. By creating, deploying, and evaluating new methods in collaboration with public sector partners, we hope both to advance the state of the art in machine learning and to improve the quality of public health, safety, and security. We are particularly interested in solving challenging urban problems where off-the-shelf machine learning methods are insufficient and new innovations are required. Climate &amp; Ocean Physics @ NYU: Our group aims to advance the fundamental understanding of ocean dynamics and its role in the climate system in order to improve climate change projections.

The top few teams (exact amount varies per year) will advance to the North America Championship (NAC). The top few teams from NAC will advance to the World Finals. The competition is usually held in the fall semester. As a result of NYU acquiring Polytechnic (Tandon), NYU sends teams for both schools separately and teams cannot have a mix of CAS and Tandon students (Tandon students must be on the Tandon team and non-Tandon students must be registered on the CAS team).
