# NYU CS Wiki

## What is this❓

CS has become increasingly competitive. We created this website as a way to help students identify resources to further their education and career.

The website consists of:

- Academics (excelling in coursework)
- Opportunities (doing well career-wise or with research)
- Recreation (fun activities)

BUGS@NYU believes these resources should be available to the CS community at NYU both at CAS and Tandon for students to prepare for their career. Please help by creating posts to better the NYU CS community!
